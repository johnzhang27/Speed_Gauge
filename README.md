# Speed_Gauge

NOTE: This is the speed gauge QML widget that Albertaloop GUI project is using. The speed gauge is made by Marko Mattila, I modified some codes in main.qml and main.cpp in order to meet the requirement of Albertaloop project.

For now, I'm be able to pass the object from C++ to QML.

Future Plan: I will try to make it keep receiving velocity data from a fake telemetry module(C++ or Python) without pressing the space bar.
